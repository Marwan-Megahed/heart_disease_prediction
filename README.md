# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 🫀

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health features.  
It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding, handling categorical features)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Multiple ML models implemented:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVC)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Visualizations for insights
